/**
 * A date selection component, ready to use in Sandstone applications.
 * 
 * `DatePicker`  may be used to select the year, month, and day. It uses a standard  `Date`  object for
its  `value`  which can be shared as the  `value`  for a
[TimePicker]   to select both a date and time.
 * 
 * By default,  `DatePicker`  maintains the state of its  `value`  property. Supply the
 `defaultValue`  property to control its initial value. If you wish to directly control updates
to the component, supply a value to  `value`  at creation time and update it in response to
 `onChange`  events.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * ```
<DatePicker
 defaultValue={selectedDate}
 onChange={handleChange}
/>
```
